<p>Strategr <strong>is not a calendar</strong>, but a time-boxing tool â€” by design, there is no dates, no date-bounded â€œeventsâ€ per se.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s aim is to make daily planning quick and flexible by using a bit different paradigm that conventional calendar apps use.</p>

<p>Most calendar apps are great for scheduling something like meetings and appointments, but using them for comprehensive daily planning can quickly become tedious - this is where Strategr shines.</p>
