<p>Strategr <strong>is not a calendar</strong>, but a time-boxing tool — by design, there is no dates, no date-bounded “events” per se.</p>

<p>It’s aim is to make daily planning quick and flexible by using a bit different paradigm that conventional calendar apps use.</p>

<p>Most calendar apps are great for scheduling something like meetings and appointments, but using them for comprehensive daily planning can quickly become tedious - this is where Strategr shines. Try it out youself, and see if it helps your workflow!</p>
