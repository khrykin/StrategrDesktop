<p>Strategr <strong>is not a calendar</strong>, but a time-boxing tool — by design, there are no dates, no date-bounded “events” per se.</p>

<p>It aims to make daily planning quick and flexible by using a bit different paradigm than conventional calendar apps.</p>

<p>Most calendar apps are great for scheduling something like meetings and appointments, but using them for comprehensive daily planning can quickly become tedious - this is where Strategr shines.</p>

<p>Try it out yourself, and see if it helps your workflow!</p>
