Strategr __is not a calendar__, but a time-boxing tool — by design, there are no dates, no date-bounded “events” per se.

It aims to make daily planning quick and flexible by using a slightly different paradigm than conventional calendar apps.

Most calendar apps are great for scheduling something like meetings and appointments, but using them for comprehensive daily planning can quickly become tedious - this is where Strategr shines.

Try it out yourself, and see if it helps your workflow!
